## Code organisation

The dataset could not be pushed in the git, one may need to add it after cloning the repository, in the same directory as `run.py`

`implementations.py` contains the basic functions: 

- `mean_squared_error_gd(y, tx, initial_w, max_iters, gamma)`

- `mean_squared_error_sgd(y, tx, initial_w, max_iters, gamma)`

- `least_squares(y, tx)`

- `ridge_regression(y, tx, lambda_)`

- `logistic_regression(y, tx, initial_w, max_iters, gamma)`

- `reg_logistic_regression(y, tx, lambda_, initial_w, max_iters, gamma)`

The 'Submissions' folder contains the submissions of the different models we tried

To reproduce our best submission, run `run.py`.

## Data preparation

## Feature validation

## Cross-validation steps




To do: 
- write a clear ReadMe file
- provide a code submission which will include the 6 basic method implementations, as well as the best result we had on the task
- provide a latex report of 2 pages
